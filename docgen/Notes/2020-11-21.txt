Hi, there,

As of today, I am pleased to announce that ATS3 has reached a stage
where it can be realistically used in software construction. This is
achieved after slightly more than two and one-half years of continual
development by yours truly :)

# A little history of ATS3
#
######

Essentially, ATS3 refers to the third edition of ATS, and ATS/Xanadu
is currently the only implementation of ATS3. Note that the names ATS3
and ATS/Xanadu are often used interchangeably.

In the ATS family of languages, the first implementation is named
ATS/Proto (2004) and the language it implements is referred to as
ATS0.  Please note that the implementation of ATS/Proto is written in
OCaml. The next implementation is ATS/Geizella (2007), which is also
written in OCaml. And the language implemented by ATS/Geizella is
referred to as ATS1. ATS/Anairiats (2008) is an implementation of ATS1
in itself; the implementation is first compiled by ATS/Geizella and
then by itself, succeeding in so-called bootstrapping. The next
edition of ATS is ATS2, which is given an implementation of the name
ATS/Postiats (2013) written in ATS1.

ATS/Xanadu implements ATS3 and the implementation is written in ATS2.
While there is currently no plan to bootstrap ATS3 by implementing it
in itself, it is perceivable that ATS/Xanadu can be readily translated
into such an implementation due to the fact that the difference
between ATS2 and ATS3 in terms of both syntax and semantics is fairly
minor.
