This midterm asks you to implement the following two items for the
programming language LAMBDA:

1. (100 points)

A closure-based interpreter.

2. (100 points)

A type checker (based on the Hindley style of type inference).

Please note that your implementation is required to handle the issue
of occurs-check.

The datatype for the abstract syntax for LAMBDA is given in the file
midterm.sats, WHICH SHOULD NOT BE MODIFIED WITH CONSULTING ME FIRST.

######

Testing:

Your implementation is expected to handle the following two examples:

1. (20 points)

Please implement a function of the name isPrime, which tests whether a
given natural number is a prime or not. A prime number is one that does
not have non-trivial factors, that is, factors that are not 1 or itself.

2. (30 points)

Please translate the following 8-queen puzzle implementation into
LAMBDA:
