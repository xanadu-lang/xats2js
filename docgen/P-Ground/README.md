## Playground for Xats2js

Please play with xats2js by constructing programs in ATS/Xanadu
(that is, ATS3) in this directory. For instance, there is currently
a directory of the name `githwxi` containing some simple programs
written in ATS3 and also a Makefile for compiling and testing these
programs.

Happy programming in ATS!
